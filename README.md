### Description

Platform game created using the Pygame library. The goal of this game is to complete 2 levels in the shortest possible time while avoiding clashes with zombies. "Moving" zombies can be temporarily disabled - after a short time, they will rise from the dead and hunt the player again. Each kill of a zombie subtracts one second from the total game time, so it's worth jumping on them. After reaching the flag, in the case of level one, we will be moved to the second level - once we get to the flag again the scoreboard will appear. If we were fast enough and we reached TOP10 - we enter our nickname and we can play the game again :)
